# Selling Courses

One of the main benefits of creating an online course is the ability to monetize your work and sell it as an informational product.

Lunchbox allows you to sell your courses by providing simple integrations with several other eCommerce platforms. You can create a product using one of these eCommerce platforms and use the Lunchbox integration to specify which courses that a customer should be enrolled in when they successfully purchase that product.

It is possible to enroll a customer in a Lunchbox course once they successfully purchase an item through the WooCommerce WordPress plugin.

Once you have both the WooCommerce plugin and the Lunchbox plugin installed, you'll notice on your Product's page in the WordPress admin dashboard that there is a new  metabox  that allows you to choose the courses associated with that product.

Simply check the box next to each course that you would like to enroll your purchasers in. When a customer purchases that product, they will automatically be enrolled in the associated courses.
