# Enrollment
One of the best selling points about Lunchbox courses is the flexibility offered in the different ways to protect your course contents. In this article, we'll discuss all of the different ways that your course can be protected.

Your course visibility preferences can currently be set to the following different choices:

## Free + Unprotected

If you'd like for your course to be viewable by the public with no requirements to view the lessons, you should choose this option. With this setting, all guests, visitors, and members can view the contents of your course by simply launching the course viewer.

This option is good for certain use cases such as public product training. In fact, this is the setting that we are using for our demo course at https://wplunchbox.com/courses/getting-started-with-lunchbox

## Free + Lead-Protected

If you'd like to keep your course free to enroll, but require that your site visitor creates an account on your site to view the course, you should choose this option. With this setting selected, all guest, visitors, and members will be prompted to enter their name and email address to create an account on your site. Once they enter this information, they will be enrolled in the course and all of the course contents will be visible for the user.

This is a great choice if you want to share your course contents in return for collecting potential leads for the topic of your course. You might use this to build your mailing list, share related products with your leads, etc.

## Paid + Purchase-Protected

One of the main benefits of creating an online course is the ability to monetize your work and sell it as an informational product.

Lunchbox allows you to sell your courses by providing simple integrations with several other eCommerce platforms. You can create a product using one of these eCommerce platforms and use the Lunchbox integration to specify which courses that a customer should be enrolled in when they successfully purchase that product.

If you'd like to protect your course so that only those who purchase a related product are enrolled in the course, you should choose this option. With this setting selected, all guest, visitors, and members will be directed to your product's sell page if they try to view the course contents without purchasing. Once the user has purchased your related product, they will be automatically enrolled in the course and have complete access to the course contents.

Note that the Lunchbox plugin doesn't handle any of the eCommerce transactions, shopping carts, or product pages. Lunchbox assumes that you already have a store set up using another eCommerce WordPress plugin such as Easy Digital Downloads or WooCommerce, or another eCommerce platform such as Shopify or Gumroad. Lunchbox can integrate with specific eCommerce platforms to ensure that there is a seamless connection between your online store and products, and your Lunchbox courses.

If you plan on selling access to your course, this is the obvious option. Your users can buy once and have unlimited access to the contents of your course.

## Paid + Subscription-Protected

With this option, your users will be required to have an active and valid subscription to your site (or, a specific product that you sell on your site) in order to view the contents of a course. Currently only supported by an integration with Easy Digital Downloads Recurring addon.

# Roadmap

The following options are high on the to-do list and are coming soon:
