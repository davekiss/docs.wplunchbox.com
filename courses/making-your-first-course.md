## Add a new course

If you're familiar with how to create a new post or page in WordPress, then you already know how to create a Lunchbox course. We designed Lunchbox to feel just as intuitive as using WordPress itself â€“ that way, you don't have to spend hours learning how to use an entirely new system.

To add a new course, visit your **WordPress admin dashboard**, go to the **Courses** menu option and choose **Add New** from the menu flyout.

Here, you'll see the familiar WordPress post edit screen. You'll want to use this editor to create the **Course Overview** page that describes what your course is all about.

It's a good idea to add encouraging information to this page detailing why your students should take your course. This might be in the form of testimonials, social proof, content takeaways, promotional images and videos, or other details about the main selling point of your course.

Once you're satisfied with the description you've provided for your course, click on **Save Draft** in the top right corner of the screen.

After you've saved your course, it's time to get to the real power of the Lunchbox plugin. Let's learn how to use the **Lunchbox Course Editorâ„¢**.

## Using the Course Editor

From an administrative perspective, most the time you spend building your course will be using in the **Lunchbox Course Editor**. The Course Editor was designed to be as efficient as possible, allowing you to manage all of the elements of your course on a single page. This will save you a ton of time, making it super easy to prototype and update your course. Let's get going.

### Creating a curriculum

By itself, your course is just a nice container page for the real subject matter that you're going to be sharing with your students. The actual contents of your course are found in your **curriculum** â€“ a collection of sections and lessons that will provide your students with all of the information you'll be sharing with them.

Let's add our first section and lesson to the course. Scroll down on the **Edit Course** page to find the **Lunchbox Course Editor**

You'll see that it's telling you that you don't have any lessons associated with this course just yet. Let's change that now by clicking on the **Add Lesson** button in the middle of the Course Editor.

Now, in the Course Editor, you'll see a new text box asking you to enter the name of the first lesson in this course. Let's just call it **My first lesson** for now â€“ you can always go back and change this later.

Once you've entered a lesson title, you'll want to save the lesson to your curriculum. You can easily do that just by hitting the **Enter** key on your keyboard.

Congrats! You just made your first lesson with the **Lunchbox Course Editor**.

You may have noticed a few new things appear when you saved your lesson.

- There's now a new text box just below the one you saved that will allow you to enter the name of a second lesson in your curriculum.
- If you click on the title of the existing lesson, you'll find the settings associated with that particular lesson.

Let's go over some of the available lesson settings.

#### Lesson Title
This is where you can change the title of your lesson after you've created it.

#### Short Description of Lesson
This should be a short, one-sentence description of the main takeaway of the lesson.

#### Lesson Thumbnail
You can upload a thumbnail to associate with this lesson that will appear in several places throughout the Lunchbox plugin. This is entirely optional, but may help improve the appearance of your lesson.

#### Description of Lesson Contents
In this text area, you can enter a longer description of what your students should expect to learn during this lesson. You can also add images, links, attachments, or emojis to this description ðŸ˜Š

> If you make any changes to the lesson settings, don't forget to scroll to the bottom of the lesson settings and click the **Save Lesson** button to ensure that all of your changes are saved.

### Adding a video

### Editing the section
There are also a few controls available for making edits to the **section** that was automatically created for you when you created your first lesson.

> Your course curriculum in broken up into **sections** and **lessons** â€“ think of **sections** as the chapters of a book, while **lessons** are the actual contents of the chapter.

Let's change the name of the default section from **Section 1** to **Chapter 1** by clicking the **pencil icon** next to the section name, renaming it, and then clicking the **check icon** or pressing **Enter** to save our changes.

Sweet, that was easy. You can just as easily add a second section containing its own lessons to the curriculum by clicking on the **Add New Section** button at the bottom of the curriculum.
